## User Stories

As a user who loves reading, I will be able to...
- view an extensive library of books and select a book to get more info such as the author and publish date
- view a similar list of authors and select one to view their bio
- add new books I've read to the collection
- add authors I enjoy to the collection
- edit or delete books and authors as I see fit

## Future Updates

My first goal for after finishing the base project is to implement user authentication and enable users to create their own libraries with books they've completed and would like to review and rate.

My next goal is I would like to figure out how to create a page with forums for users to discuss the book of the week, do personal introductions to make new friends, discuss other books, and maybe even some creative writing forums.

Another goal would be to implement a "friends list" where you can request to add other users as a friend and get access to their reviews and libraries. 

Last goal would be to add a link to purchase the books you search for either on amazon or barnes and noble.
