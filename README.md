# Elysium

## Project Description

Elysium is a book club website where there is a weekly book displayed for users to read and review, as well as make an account with a profile that shows their info and book interests and keep track of books they've read or want to read. 

## User Stories

As a user, I will be able to...
- make an account and customize it with my photo, bio, name, and my top 8 favorite books
- add books to my personal library of books I've read and books I plan to read
- write reviews for any book in my library
- search for books to add to my library

## MVP

My MVP goals are to create a full stack application using NodeJS on the backend and React on the front end.
- user accounts
- making my own API in mongoDB
- users personal library functionality - read books and plan to read books

I know I have not done a project with user accounts yet but I have been researching and I really want to implement it in my capstone so that is one of my main goals. 

## Stretch Goals

If I am able to get everything working early I would like to figure out how to create a page with forums for users to discuss the book of the week, do personal introductions to make new friends, discuss other books, and maybe even some creative writing forums.

Another stretch goal would be to implement a "friends list" where you can request to add other users as a friend and get access to their reviews and libraries. 

Last stretch goal would be to add a link to purchase the books you search for either on amazon or barnes and noble.
