# Elysium

## Project Description

Elysium is a book library website where there is a random book displayed for users to read when they load the home page, as well as a library of books and authors and the functionality to add in books and authors they read and want to continue their collection. 

## User Stories

As a user, I will be able to...
- view an extensive library of books and select a book to get more info such as the author and publish date
- view a similar list of authors and select one to view their bio
- add new books I've read to the collection
- add authors I enjoy to the collection
- edit or delete books and authors as I see fit

## MVP

My MVP goals are to create a full stack application using NodeJS on the backend and React on the front end.
- books and authors collections in database
- making my own API in mongoDB 

## Stretch Goals

My first stretch goal for after MVP is to implement user authentication and enable users to create their own libraries with books they've completed and would like to review and rate.

My next stretch goal is I would like to figure out how to create a page with forums for users to discuss the book of the week, do personal introductions to make new friends, discuss other books, and maybe even some creative writing forums.

Another stretch goal would be to implement a "friends list" where you can request to add other users as a friend and get access to their reviews and libraries. 

Last stretch goal would be to add a link to purchase the books you search for either on amazon or barnes and noble.
